# JHU Government & Policy — Enrollment Data Pipeline & Dashboard

A full-stack solution for parsing, cleaning, uploading to Airtable, and visualizing enrollment data for the Johns Hopkins University School of Government & Policy.

---

## Overview

This project addresses three deliverables from the team:

1. **Data Cleaning** — Parse a raw CSV with deeply nested, multi-delimiter fields into normalized, relational tables.
2. **Airtable Integration** — Upload cleaned data to an Airtable base via the REST + Metadata APIs so the team can review before the funder meeting.
3. **Dean's Dashboard** — An interactive React visualization answering: *Where have we had the most impact?* and *Which cities are most engaged?*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with pip
- **Node.js 18+** with npm (for the React dashboard)
- An **Airtable account** (free tier works)

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Parse & Clean the Data

```bash
python src/parse_data.py
```

Output:
```
✅ Saved clean data to data/cleaned/
   • 20 leaders
   • 12 cities
   • 51 course enrollments
```

### 3. Upload to Airtable

Create a base with three tables named **Leaders**, **Cities**, **Enrollments** (see [docs/airtable_setup.md](docs/airtable_setup.md)), then:

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:AIRTABLE_PAT = "patXXXXXXXXXX"
$env:AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = "appXXXXXXXXXX"
python src/airtable_upload.py
```

```bash
# Mac/Linux
export AIRTABLE_PAT="patXXXXXXXXXX"
export AIRTABLE_BASE_ID="appXXXXXXXXXX"
python src/airtable_upload.py
```

The script automatically creates all required fields via the Metadata API, then uploads records in batches of 10.

### 4. Launch the React Dashboard

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Government leaders enrolled | 20 |
| Cities reached | 12 |
| Course enrollments | 51 |
| Completion rate | 90% |
| Average score (completed) | 91.8% |

**Top cities by engagement:**

1. **Baltimore, MD** — 9 enrollments, 4 leaders, 92.1% avg score
2. **San Francisco, CA** — 8 enrollments, 3 leaders, 92.6% avg score
3. **Austin, TX** — 6 enrollments, 2 leaders, 93.5% avg score

**Program centers:** BCPI leads with 28 enrollments (55%), GovEx has 23 (45%).

## Technical Decisions

### Data Parsing
The raw CSV uses three layers of delimiters within single fields: pipes (`|`) for sub-records, tildes (`~`) for course attributes, and colons (`:`) for key-value pairs. The parser handles each layer independently, then joins on course name to match enrollments with completion statuses.

### Airtable Integration
The upload script uses the Airtable **Metadata API** (`/meta/bases/{id}/tables/{id}/fields`) to programmatically create fields with correct types (number, date, email, text) before uploading any records. This avoids the "Unknown field name" errors that occur with the standard Records API alone. Records are uploaded in batches of 10 with rate limiting (250ms between requests).

### React Dashboard
Built with **Vite + React + Recharts**. Component architecture separates data processing (`useEnrollmentData` hook) from presentation (8 focused components). All metrics are derived from a single JSON source at build time — no runtime API calls needed. JHU brand colors (navy, gold) are applied via CSS custom properties.

### Fallback Dashboard
A standalone `visualizations/dashboard.html` file is included for environments without Node.js. It's fully self-contained — no dependencies, no build step, works offline.
